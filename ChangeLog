	* NLeadingJets switch and User functions added to JetHists
	* Variable Binned Histograms in HistogramManager

2015-03-10 Marco Milesi <Marco.Milesi@cern.ch>
        * Added possibility to use cut-based PID in ElectronSelector (Changed electronSelect*.config file accordingly)
	* Configuration files for ElectronSelector tools are passed directly via config
	* Append module name to CP Tool name in constructor (to avoid asg::ToolStore::put warning when using multiple instances of same xAODAnaHelpers module)

2015-03-11 Marco Milesi <Marco.Milesi@cern.ch>
        * Releasing tag 00-00-02 (for ASG Base,2.1.27)
      
2015-03-26 Marco Milesi <Marco.Milesi@cern.ch>
        * Added function isFilePrimaryxAOD() to know if a sample is a primary xAOD (if not, its a DxAOD!) in HelperFunctions
	* Added MuonEfficiencyCorrector module. Efficiency SF systematics are added as decorations
	* Revamped MetaData reading in BasicEventSelection.cxx . This is not going to be definitive though...

2015-03-28 Marco Milesi <Marco.Milesi@cern.ch>
        * Small changes to TreeAlgo to make other algorithms inherit from it

2015-03-30 Marco Milesi <Marco.Milesi@cern.ch>
        * Developed all (?) the systematics machinery for Electrons
        * Tested in ASG Base,2.1.29
2015-04-01 Marco Milesi <Marco.Milesi@cern.ch>
	* Changed Systematics logic in OverlapRemoval
	* Fixed bugs in Systematics logic in ElectronEfficiencyCorrector and ElectronSelector
